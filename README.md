ðŸŽ¸ RiffMatch â€“ Find Your Bandmates

Built with :
Front-End : ReactJS + Tailwind CSS + Vite
Back-End : SupaBase

Problem:
Musicians often struggle to find others who match their skill level, genre, or vibe. Whether you're into jazz, metal, or indie rock. It's tough finding the right people to jam with, especially those who are serious and musically compatible!

Solution:
I built RiffMatch, a platform that works like a matchmaking lobby for musicians. Hereâ€™s how it works:

ðŸŽ¶ Musicians can create a lobby with details like genre, skill level, role needed (e.g. drummer, bassist, etc.), and preferred songs.

ðŸ§­ Others can browse open lobbies and request to join the ones they vibe with.

âœ… The lobby owner can accept or reject requests.

ðŸ’¬ Once matched, they can connect and take their jamming session out there.

RiffMatch is all about bringing musicians together, the right ones. Whether youâ€™re looking to form a band or just want a good weekend jam, RiffMatch helps you find your people.
